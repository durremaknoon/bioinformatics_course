## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Task 1
```{r, comment=NA}
sum(5:55)

```

## Task 2
```{r, comment=NA}
sumfun <- function(n) {sum(5:n)}
sumfun(10)
sumfun(20)
sumfun(100)
```

## Task3
```{r, comment=NA}
Fibonacci <-numeric(12)
Fibonacci[1] <- Fibonacci[2] <- 1
for(i in 3:12) {Fibonacci[i] <- Fibonacci[i-2] + Fibonacci[i-1] }
print(Fibonacci)
```
## Task4
```{r, comment=NA}
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")
Gear <- as.factor(mtcars$gear) 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=Gear, y=mpg, fill=Gear)) + geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3)



```


## Task 5
```{r, comment=NA}
distance <- lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)
summary(distance)
```
Task 5 answers:  

Fitted slope = 3.9324  

Intercept = -17.5791  

Standard deviation: Dist = 6.7584, speed = 0.4155  

## Task 6
```{r, comment=NA}
library(ggplot2)
data("cars")
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + 
  geom_point(color='#2980B9', size = 4) + xlim(c(0, 25)) + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE, color='#2C3E50') + 
  labs(title='Linear relationship between speed and the breaking distance', x='Speed in mph', y='Breaking Distance in feet')
```

## Task 7 (Part 1)
```{r, comment=NA}
library(ggplot2)
data("cars")
new_speed <- cars$speed * (5280/3600)
lm_1 <- lm(dist ~ 0 + new_speed + I(new_speed^2), cars)
summary(lm_1)

```
Yes. We get reasonable results because 0.84479 is the slope of the line which in our case represents average reaction speed. It seems like a realistic average reaction speed for the driver to start breaking. 

## Task 7 (Part 2)
```{r, comment=NA}
y <- cars$dist
x <- cars$new_speed
ggplot(cars, aes(new_speed, dist)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula="y~0+x+I(x^2)") + labs(title ="Average reaction time for driver to start breaking", x="New Speed in seconds", y="Distance in feet")


```
